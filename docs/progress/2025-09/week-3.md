# Weekly Progress - September 2025, Week 3

**Week of:** September 15-21, 2025
**Project:** AutoGen Local Fork - Multi-Agent Planning Framework

## Accomplished This Week

### Repository Setup ✅
- **Forked Microsoft AutoGen** to personal repository `autogen-local`
- **Updated git remote** to point to personal fork (safety measure)
- **Updated README.md** with proper fork attribution and custom additions documentation

### Core Framework Development ✅
- **Created Multi-Agent Planning Framework** (`planning_discussion.py`)
  - Implemented 5 specialized agent personas:
    - Product Manager: Business requirements and user needs
    - System Architect: Technical design and architecture patterns
    - Senior Developer: Implementation feasibility and complexity
    - QA Engineer: Testing strategy and quality concerns
    - Project Manager: Timeline, risks, and coordination
  - Built placeholder system for testing structure before LLM integration
  - Designed discussion flow simulation

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- **Created basic testing framework** (`test_basic.py`)
- **Verified AutoGen installation** and import functionality
- **Documented configuration requirements** for LLM integration

### Project Documentation ✅
- **Applied Universal Project Documentation Standard**
- **Created CURRENT_STATUS.md** with honest assessment of project state
- **Created ACTIVE_PLAN.md** with 3-phase development approach
- **Set up standard docs/ directory structure**

## Current Status
- **Framework Structure:** Complete but non-functional (placeholder clients)
- **Repository Safety:** Secured with personal fork
- **Documentation:** Aligned with standards

## Next Week Priority
**Phase 1, Task 1:** Choose and configure LLM provider for actual agent functionality

## Lessons Learned
- Git remote safety is critical when working with forks of large projects
- Starting with placeholders allows architecture validation before expensive LLM integration
- Documentation standards provide clarity on project reality vs aspirations

## Blockers Identified
- Need to choose LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure)
- Need to set up API credentials securely
- Cost considerations for multi-agent token usage
