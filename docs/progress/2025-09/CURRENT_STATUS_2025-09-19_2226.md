# Current Status - AutoGen Local Fork

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-19
**Project Status:** Infrastructure Development & Testing
**Archived Version:** [CURRENT_STATUS_2025-09-19_1315.md](docs/progress/2025-09/CURRENT_STATUS_2025-09-19_1315.md)

## Current Reality

### What Exists
- ‚úÖ **Forked Repository**: Successfully forked Microsoft's AutoGen to `autogen-local`
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Agent Planning Framework**: Basic structure implemented in `planning_discussion.py`
  - 5 specialized agent personas (Product Manager, Architect, Developer, QA Engineer, Project Manager)
  - Placeholder model clients (not connected to actual LLMs)
  - Simulation framework for testing discussion flow
- ‚úÖ **Basic Testing**: Installation verification in `test_basic.py`
- ‚úÖ **Fork Documentation**: README updated with proper attribution and custom additions
- üîß **Infrastructure Layer**: Framework prepared for workspace orchestration
  - Redis-based coordination architecture designed
  - Kafka messaging framework structured
  - Docker containerization for test infrastructure
  - Integration bridge interface defined (requires implementation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Infrastructure Testing**: Bridge implementation pending for actual Redis/Kafka integration

### Recent Breakthrough
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Model Integration**: Fixed coordination framework for reliable AI discussions
  - Response time optimized from 13.98s to ~1.87s average
  - Custom coordination bypasses AutoGen timeout issues
  - Performance optimization with fast model selection

### What's Not Working Yet
- ‚ùå **Infrastructure Bridge**: Missing bridge.py implementation for Redis/Kafka
- ‚ùå **Persistent Storage**: No actual connection to infrastructure services
- ‚ùå **File Locking**: Coordination layer interface exists but not connected
- ‚ùå **Audit Trails**: Event logging prepared but not persisting to infrastructure

### Technical State
- **Git Status**: Multi-model framework operational, infrastructure bridge needed
- **Installation**: AutoGen packages installed in `autogen-env/`
- **Dependencies**: Ollama integration working, Redis/Kafka clients needed
- **Architecture**: Multi-model coordination working, infrastructure interface designed
- **Multi-Model**: 3 AI models coordinating successfully (~1.87s response time)
- **Testing**: Multi-model discussions verified, infrastructure tests pending bridge implementation

## Immediate Blockers
1. **Infrastructure Bridge Implementation**: Need to create bridge.py for Redis/Kafka connection
2. **Infrastructure Services**: Need Redis and Kafka services running for integration
3. **Integration Testing**: Cannot verify infrastructure coordination without bridge.py

## Next Critical Steps
1. Implement bridge.py for actual Redis/Kafka integration
2. Create required infrastructure model classes
3. Test end-to-end infrastructure coordination
4. Verify performance with infrastructure overhead
5. Add proper error handling for infrastructure failures
6. Complete integration testing and validation

## Project Scope Reminder
This is a **personal experimentation fork** focused on:
- Multi-agent planning and design review discussions
- Custom agent personas for different business roles
- Learning and experimenting with AutoGen capabilities
- NOT intended for production use or contribution back to Microsoft
