# Active Plan - AutoGen Multi-Agent Planning Framework

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2025-09-19
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-19

## Objective
Transform the placeholder multi-agent planning framework into a functional system for design reviews and planning discussions using real LLM providers.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current)
**Goal:** Get the basic multi-agent framework operational

### Tasks
1. **LLM Provider Configuration**
   - Choose primary LLM provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure)
   - Set up API credentials securely
   - Test basic model connectivity

2. **Framework Integration**
   - Replace PlaceholderModelClient with real model clients
   - Update agent instantiation to use actual LLMs
   - Test basic agent-to-agent communication

3. **Basic Functionality Verification**
   - Run simple multi-agent discussion
   - Verify RoundRobinGroupChat functionality
   - Test different discussion topics

## Phase 2: Agent Persona Refinement
**Goal:** Optimize agent behaviors and discussion quality

### Tasks
1. **Persona Development**
   - Refine system messages for each agent type
   - Test and iterate on agent responses
   - Add specific domain knowledge prompts

2. **Discussion Flow Optimization**
   - Implement structured discussion rounds
   - Add decision synthesis mechanisms
   - Create discussion summaries and action items

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Test with various planning scenarios
   - Validate agent responses stay in character
   - Ensure productive discussion outcomes

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Goal:** Add sophisticated planning and collaboration features

### Tasks
1. **Enhanced Capabilities**
   - Add document analysis capabilities
   - Implement decision tracking
   - Create planning templates

2. **Integration Features**
   - Export discussion summaries
   - Integration with project management tools
   - Add human-in-the-loop capabilities

## Current Focus: Phase 1, Task 1
**Next Action:** Choose and configure LLM provider

### Decision Points
- **Provider Options:** OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Azure OpenAI
- **Considerations:** Cost, API reliability, response quality for multi-agent use
- **Recommendation:** Start with OpenAI for established AutoGen integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can instantiate real agents with LLM providers
- [ ] Agents can communicate in multi-round discussions
- [ ] Each persona maintains distinct perspective
- [ ] Framework produces useful planning insights
- [ ] System is reliable and responsive

## Known Risks
1. **API Costs**: Multi-agent discussions may consume significant tokens
2. **Response Quality**: Agents may not maintain consistent personas
3. **Discussion Focus**: Conversations may drift off-topic
4. **Technical Integration**: AutoGen + LLM provider compatibility issues

## Notes
- Keep this experimental and learning-focused
- Document lessons learned for future multi-agent projects
- Consider cost management strategies for LLM usage
