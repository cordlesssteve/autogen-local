# Multi-Agent Planning Framework Architecture

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-19
**Status:** Design Phase

## System Overview

The Multi-Agent Planning Framework creates specialized AI agents that collaborate on planning and design reviews. Each agent represents a different business role perspective, contributing their domain expertise to comprehensive discussions.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Agent Types

1. **Product Manager Agent**
   - Focus: Business requirements, user needs, market considerations
   - Responsibilities: ROI assessment, feature prioritization, stakeholder alignment
   - Perspective: Business value and user impact

2. **System Architect Agent**
   - Focus: Technical design, architecture patterns, scalability
   - Responsibilities: Technology selection, integration strategies, long-term vision
   - Perspective: Technical feasibility and architectural soundness

3. **Senior Developer Agent**
   - Focus: Implementation complexity, code quality, development experience
   - Responsibilities: Effort estimation, technical debt assessment, tooling requirements
   - Perspective: Implementation challenges and practical solutions

4. **QA Engineer Agent**
   - Focus: Testing strategy, quality assurance, risk assessment
   - Responsibilities: Test coverage, automation, edge case identification
   - Perspective: Quality risks and validation approaches

5. **Project Manager Agent**
   - Focus: Timeline, resources, coordination, risk management
   - Responsibilities: Milestone planning, team coordination, delivery planning
   - Perspective: Project feasibility and execution considerations

## Discussion Flow Design

### Round-Robin Pattern
- Structured discussion rounds with each agent contributing
- Ensures all perspectives are heard
- Prevents domination by any single viewpoint

### Discussion Phases
1. **Initial Analysis**: Each agent provides perspective on the topic
2. **Cross-Examination**: Agents can respond to others' points
3. **Synthesis**: Collaborative decision-making and consensus building

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation
```python
class PlanningDiscussionFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
        self.setup_agents()

    def setup_agents(self):
        # Creates specialized agents with distinct personas

    async def start_discussion(self, topic: str, rounds: int = 3):
        # Orchestrates multi-agent discussion
```

### Integration Points
- **AutoGen Framework**: Built on Microsoft's AutoGen multi-agent system
- **LLM Providers**: Configurable model clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure)
- **Discussion Orchestration**: RoundRobinGroupChat for structured conversations

## Design Principles

1. **Distinct Perspectives**: Each agent maintains consistent domain expertise
2. **Structured Collaboration**: Organized discussion flow prevents chaos
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Business, technical, and operational viewpoints
4. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new agent types or modify existing ones
5. **Cost Conscious**: Designed to manage LLM token usage efficiently

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Scalability
- Support for larger agent teams
- Parallel discussion streams
- Dynamic agent selection based on topic

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Document analysis integration
- Decision tracking and persistence
- Integration with external planning tools

### Quality Assurance
- Agent response validation
- Discussion quality metrics
- Automated summarization
