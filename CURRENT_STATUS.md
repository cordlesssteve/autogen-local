# Current Status - AutoGen Local Fork

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-19
**Project Status:** Infrastructure Development & Testing
**Archived Version:** [CURRENT_STATUS_2025-09-19_1315.md](docs/progress/2025-09/CURRENT_STATUS_2025-09-19_1315.md)

## Current Reality

### What Exists
- ✅ **Forked Repository**: Successfully forked Microsoft's AutoGen to `autogen-local`
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Planning Framework**: Basic structure implemented in `planning_discussion.py`
  - 5 specialized agent personas (Product Manager, Architect, Developer, QA Engineer, Project Manager)
  - Placeholder model clients (not connected to actual LLMs)
  - Simulation framework for testing discussion flow
- ✅ **Basic Testing**: Installation verification in `test_basic.py`
- ✅ **Fork Documentation**: README updated with proper attribution and custom additions
- ✅ **Infrastructure Layer**: Complete workspace orchestration infrastructure
  - Redis-based real-time coordination and file locking
  - Kafka-based persistent messaging and audit trails
  - Docker containerization for test infrastructure
  - Integration bridge with graceful degradation
- ✅ **Real Infrastructure Testing**: Working integration tests with actual Redis/Kafka

### Recent Breakthrough
- ✅ **Connection State Management**: Fixed critical bugs in Redis/Kafka connection handling
  - Infrastructure connection now works in 245ms vs previous 5+ second timeouts
  - Agent registration: 3ms (was timing out)
  - File locking operations: 34ms (was timing out)
  - File edit events: 1ms (was timing out)

### What's Not Working Yet
- ❌ **No LLM Integration**: Using placeholder clients, no actual AI conversations
- ❌ **No Real Testing**: Agents cannot actually communicate
- ❌ **Missing Configuration**: No API keys or model provider setup
- ❌ **No Actual Multi-Agent Discussions**: Framework exists but not functional

### Technical State
- **Git Status**: Ready for commit (infrastructure fixes completed)
- **Installation**: AutoGen packages installed in `autogen-env/`
- **Dependencies**: Basic AutoGen framework + infrastructure components
- **Architecture**: Planning framework + infrastructure layer operational
- **Infrastructure**: Redis/Kafka orchestration working reliably
- **Testing**: Real infrastructure integration tests passing

## Immediate Blockers
1. **LLM Provider Configuration**: Need to choose and configure actual model providers
2. **API Key Setup**: No credentials configured for any LLM services
3. **Integration Testing**: Cannot verify multi-agent functionality without working LLMs

## Next Critical Steps
1. Choose LLM provider(s) for development
2. Set up API credentials securely
3. Replace placeholder clients with real model connections
4. Test actual multi-agent discussions with infrastructure coordination
5. Iterate on agent personas and discussion patterns
6. Connect LLM agents to workspace infrastructure for collaborative editing

## Project Scope Reminder
This is a **personal experimentation fork** focused on:
- Multi-agent planning and design review discussions
- Custom agent personas for different business roles
- Learning and experimenting with AutoGen capabilities
- NOT intended for production use or contribution back to Microsoft
