Multi-Agent Planning and Design Review Discussion Framework

This creates different agent personas that collaborate on planning and design reviews:
- Product Manager: Business requirements and user needs
- Architect: Technical design and system architecture
- Developer: Implementation feasibility and complexity
- QA Engineer: Testing strategy and quality concerns
- Project Manager: Timeline, risks, and coordination

Each agent has different perspectives and expertise to contribute to discussions.
